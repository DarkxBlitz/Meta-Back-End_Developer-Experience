To create a model the basic skeleton is this:
In models.py (app_level):

from django.db import models

class [class_name_goes_here] (models):
    [attribute goes here] = models.[form_field_type_goes_here]([arguments_goes_here])


After you created your model you must then go to admin.py and it should look like this:

from .models import [class_name_goes_here]

admin.site.register([name_of_class_from_models.py_goes_here])


after you have linked the model to the admin.py file you must then perform migrations

python3 manage.py makemigrations

python3 manage.py migrate

Now you can run the server and check out the changes

python3 manage.py runserver
