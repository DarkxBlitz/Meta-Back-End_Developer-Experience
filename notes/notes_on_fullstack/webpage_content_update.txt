To capture user input, you can use the built-in prompt() method, like this:

let answer = prompt('What is your name?');

Once you have the user-provided input inside the answer variable, you can manipulate it any way you need to.

For example, you can output the typed-in information on the screen, as an <h1> HTML element.

Here's how you'd do that:

let answer = prompt('What is your name?');
if (typeof(answer) === 'string') {
    var h1 = document.createElement('h1')
    h1.innerText = answer;
    document.body.innerText = '';
    document.body.appendChild(h1);
}

This is probably the quickest and easiest way to capture user input on a website, but doing it this way is not the most efficient approach, especially in more complex scenarios.

This is where HTML forms come in.

You can code a script that will take an input from an HTML form and display the text that a user types in on the screen.

Here's how this is done.

You'll begin by coding out a test solution to the task at hand:

var h1 = document.createElement('h1')
h1.innerText = "Type into the input to make this text change"

var input = document.createElement('input')
input.setAttribute('type', 'text')

document.body.innerText = '';
document.body.appendChild(h1);
document.body.appendChild(input);

So, you're essentially doing the same thing as you did before, only this time you're also dynamically adding the input element, and you're setting its HTML type attribute to text. That way, when you start typing in it, the letters will be showing in the h1 element above.

However, you're not quite there yet. At this point, the code above, when run on a live website, will add the h1 element with the text Type into the input to make this text change, and an empty input form field under it.

You can try this code out yourself, for example, by pointing your browser to the example.com website and running the above code in the console.

Tip: Remember you can access the console from the developer tools in your browser.


Another thing that you did in the code above is setting variables using the var keyword.

Although it's better to use either let or const, you're just running a quick experiment on a live website, and you want to use the most lenient variable keyword, the one that will not complain about you having already set the h1 or the input variables.

If you had a complete project with a modern JavaScript tooling setup, you'd be using let or const, but this is just a quick demo, so using var in this case is okay.

The next thing that you need to do is set up an event listener. The event you're listening for is the change event. In this case, the change event will fire after you've typed in the input and pressed the ENTER key.

Here's your updated code:


var h1 = document.createElement('h1')
h1.innerText = "Type into the input to make this text change"

var input = document.createElement('input')
input.setAttribute('type', 'text')

document.body.innerText = '';
document.body.appendChild(h1);
document.body.appendChild(input);

input.addEventListener('change', function() {
    console.log(input.value)
})

This time, when you run the above code on the said example.com website, and you subsequently type some text into the input field and press the ENTER key, you'll get the value of the typed-in text logged to the console.

Now, the only thing you still need to do to complete the code is to update the text content of the h1 element with the value you got from the input field.

Here's the complete, updated code:

var h1 = document.createElement('h1')
h1.innerText = "Type into the input to make this text change"

var input = document.createElement('input')
input.setAttribute('type', 'text')

document.body.innerText = '';
document.body.appendChild(h1);
document.body.appendChild(input);

input.addEventListener('change', function() {
    h1.innerText = input.value
})


After this update, whatever you type into the input after pressing the ENTER key will be shown as the text inside the h1 element.
