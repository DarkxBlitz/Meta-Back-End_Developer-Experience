here's a basic form py file

from django import forms


Food_Service = (
    ("1", "Delivery"),
    ("2", "Order In"),
    ("3", "Take out"),
)

#create your form
class InputForm(forms.Form):
    first_name = forms.CharField(max_length=200)
    last_name = forms.CharField(max_length=200)
    shift = forms.ChoiceField(choices = Food_Service)
    time_log = forms.TimeField()
    
#Don't forget to add this to your views file in the app directory

#in the views.py folder add:
from [insertappnamehere].forms import InputForm

#then create a function in the views.py file
#also create a python template folder inside the app directory
#then make sure you update urls.py file in both directory, the project and app directory
