1. download MySQL from their website 

https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/

1.2. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE MySQL added to environment variables so you can access mysql in the command line for any program:

go to: system properties or system variables

go to environment variables

look for system variables and click on Path -> Edit...

click New and then copy and paste the path for your program in our case it is:

C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin

2.0. IF USING VIRTUAL ENV MAKE SURE TO INSTALL mysqlclient:

pip3 install mysqlclient

2. go to MySQL command line and enter the following:

mysql -u root -p

note that -u represents username and -p represents password

3. Now you can start putting any command, lets start with creating a database:

CREATE DATABASE [name_of_your_database_goes_here];

4. Optional, you can check that you created succesfully and show your other databases with this command:

SHOW DATABASES:

5. Need a database driver, django recommends using connector "mysqlclient"

6. To establish connection with a django project you must go to settings.py and enter the following:

DATABASES = {
    'default':{
        'ENGINE': 'Django.db.backends.mysql',
        'OPTIONS':{
            'read_default_file': 'etc/mysql/my.cnf',
        }
    }
}

FOR EASIER PURPOSES YOU CAN USE:

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': 'littlelemon',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'USER': 'root',
        'PASSWORD':'password',
        'PORT': '3306',
    }
}

and then type in the mysql cmd:

show databases;

use littlelemon;

show tables;

python3 manage.py makemigrations

python3 manage.py migrate

and if the above works then you're all done!
